Our New Relic Flutter agent monitors your Flutter mobile app and provides deep insights into your app's performance, errors, and user experience. Once you install and configure the Flutter agent, you'll be able to:

* **Capture Dart errors:** Identify and fix problems quickly.
* **Track network requests:** See how your app interacts with the backend.
* **Use distributed tracing:** Drill down into handled exceptions and find the root cause.
* **Create custom events and metrics:** Understand how your users interact with your app.

## Compatibility requirements [#requirements]

Before you install the Flutter agent, ensure your Flutter app meets these version requirements:

* Flutter 2.5.0 or higher
* Dart versions 2.16.2 or higher, up to but not including 3.0.0
* [Android-native requirements](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/get-started/new-relic-android-compatibility-requirements)
* [iOS-native requirements](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/get-started/new-relic-ios-compatibility-requirements)

## Install the Flutter agent [#install]

To install the Flutter agent, follow our [guided install](https://onenr.io/0gR70k5oZjo), located directly in the UI.

## Customize the agent instrumentation [#mobile-sdk]

Need to customize your agent instrumentation? Our public mobile SDK API methods let you collect custom data, configure default settings, and more.

The following customizations are available for the Flutter agent.

          * [Remove an attribute](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/remove-attribute)
          * [Remove all attributes](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/remove-all-attributes)
          * [Record custom events](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/record-custom-events)
          * [Set the maximum size of an event pool](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/set-max-event-pool-size)
          * [Set maximum time the agent stores events in memory](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/set-max-event-buffer-time)
          * [Get a current session's ID](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/current-session-id)
          * [Set a custom user ID to associate with events and attributes](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/mobile-sdk/set-custom-user-id)

## Troubleshoot HTTP errors [#http-errors]

Missing HTTP data in the UI?

After installing the Flutter agent, wait at least 5 minutes. If no HTTP data appears on the HTTP errors and HTTP requests UI pages, make sure you are not overriding `HttpOverrides.global` inside your Flutter app.

## Query Flutter log data [#logs]

New Relic stores your Flutter logs as custom events. You can query these logs and build dashboards for them using this NRQL query:
```
 SELECT * FROM `Mobile Dart Console Events` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO
```

For more information on NRQL queries, see [Introduction to NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/#where).
